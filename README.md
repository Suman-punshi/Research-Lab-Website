The website project is a collaborative effort by a multidisciplinary research group focusing on computer vision, data science, and AI. It aims to establish a world-class research center for collaborative research and student exchange. The project involves the use of HTML, CSS, and Flask for frontend and backend development, as well as the implementation of entity-relationship diagrams, database views, triggers, and stored procedures. The outcomes include learning HTML, CSS, and Flask, connecting Flask with a SQL database, data collection, and implementing dynamic tables and customization on web pages.
Frontend:
The project aims to establish a world-class research center for collaborative research and student exchange in the field of AI. The frontend development includes the use of HTML and CSS for creating web pages and defining their structure and appearance. These technologies allow for the creation of dynamic and customizable web pages.
Backend:
The backend of the website project utilizes Python and Flask for developing web applications. Flask is a lightweight and flexible micro-framework that is easy to learn and suitable for small to medium-sized web applications. It provides a simple and expressive syntax that allows developers to create dynamic web content based on user requests. Python, often used for server-side scripting, handles dynamic content generation, data processing, interaction with databases, and dynamic HTML content generation.
